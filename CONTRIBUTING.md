## üí¨ How to Contribute

We welcome contributions in various forms:

*   **üêõ Reporting Bugs:** If you find a bug, please open an issue in the project's issue tracker (if one is set up, otherwise communicate through the agreed channel).
    *   Describe the bug clearly, including steps to reproduce it.
    *   Mention your browser and operating system.

*   **üìù Code Contributions:** If you'd like to contribute code, please follow the steps below.

## üíª Code Contribution Workflow

1.  **Fork the Repository (if applicable):**
    If the project is hosted on a platform like GitHub, fork the repository to your own account.

2.  **Clone your fork (or the main repository if working directly):**
    ```bash
    git clone https://your-fork-url/Job-Tracker.git
    cd Job-Tracker
    ```

3.  **Create a New Branch:**
    Create a descriptive branch name for your feature or bugfix.
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/your-awesome-feature
    # or
    git checkout -b bugfix/fix-that-annoying-bug
    ```

4.  **Make Your Changes:**
    *   Write clean, readable, and well-commented code.
    *   Follow the existing code style and patterns.
    *   Ensure your changes are TypeScript-compliant.
    *   Update or add type definitions in `types.ts` if necessary.
    *   If adding new UI components, try to make them reusable and place them in the appropriate `components/ui/` or feature-specific directory.

5.  **Test Your Changes:**
    *   Thoroughly test your changes locally by opening `index.html` in your browser.
    *   Ensure existing functionality is not broken.
    *   Test across different screen sizes if your changes affect responsiveness.

6.  **Commit Your Changes:**
    Write clear and concise commit messages. A good commit message summarizes the changes and why they were made.
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "feat: Add dark mode toggle"
    # or
    git commit -m "fix: Correctly parse CSV files with quoted commas"
    ```
    *(Consider using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for commit message formatting.)*

7.  **Push to Your Branch:**
    ```bash
    git push origin feature/your-awesome-feature
    ```

8.  **Open a Pull Request (PR):**
    *   If using a platform like GitHub, navigate to the original repository and open a Pull Request from your forked branch to the main branch of the original repository.
    *   Provide a clear title and description for your PR.
    *   Reference any related issues (e.g., "Closes #123").
    *   Be prepared to discuss your changes and make adjustments based on feedback.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Development Environment

As mentioned in the `README.md`, this project runs directly from `index.html` using ES Modules.

*   **No Build Step:** You don't need to run a separate build command. Simply save your `.ts` or `.tsx` files, and refresh the `index.html` page in your browser to see the changes.
*   **Dependencies:** Dependencies like React and React Router are loaded via CDN using import maps in `index.html`. There's no `package.json` or `node_modules` in the current setup.

## üé® Coding Style and Conventions

*   **TypeScript:** Use TypeScript for all JavaScript code. Adhere to strong typing.
*   **React:** Utilize functional components and React Hooks.
*   **Tailwind CSS:** Follow Tailwind CSS utility-first principles for styling.
*   **Readability:** Prioritize clean, readable, and well-organized code.
*   **Accessibility (A11y):** Keep accessibility in mind. Use ARIA attributes where appropriate and ensure keyboard navigability.
